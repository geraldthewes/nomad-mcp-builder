description: "Terminate a running build job.

IMPORTANT: This service implements graceful job termination to prevent corruption of Docker and registry operations. Always use this killJob endpoint instead of direct Nomad job commands (nomad job stop, nomad job deregister, etc.) to ensure proper cleanup and prevent corrupted images or registry state."
